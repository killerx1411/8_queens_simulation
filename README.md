 
ðŸ§  8 Queens Problem Visualization This project is a fully interactive simulation of the classic 8 Queens problem, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the D3.js visualization library. It demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm can be used to find all valid configurations of 8 queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

The entire logic, styling, and visualization are embedded within a single HTML file, making it lightweight and easy to deploy or share.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals To help learners understand how the backtracking algorithm works.

To visualize each step of the algorithm in real-time.

To make algorithm learning more engaging and intuitive.

To demonstrate how data structures, control flow, and visual logic can work together to solve complex problems.
